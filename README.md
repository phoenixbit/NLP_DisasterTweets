# NLP_DisasterTweets

## Overview
Project utilizing NLP to identify tweets related to actual disasters. This initiative aims to employ multiple models to predict tweets that reference real disasters. 


## Dataset
Dataset taken from Kaggle [dataset]([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data?select=train.csv)) where the data relates to tweets from the platform X (formerly popularly known as Twitter).

There are 10746 entries in the train and test files together.

There are 5 distinct column titles: id, keyword, location, text, and target.

The descriptions of each of the column titles are as follows:
1. id: Primary key referring to the id number of the tweet.
2. keyword: Referring to a keyword within the tweet.
3. location: The location wherein the tweet was sent.
4. text: Referring to the tweet itself.
5. target: The value can either be 0 or 1 where 0 denotes a tweet that does not relate to a disaster, and 1 denotes a tweet that relates to a disaster.
